			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<img id="profile-picture" src="assets/images/Mike-Wolf.png" alt="Michael Wolf" title="Hello, my name is Mike!">
			<p class="lhOneEM">Hi there, my name is Mike! I attended St. John's University for 3 years (2009-2012) where I studied Actuarial Science and Business; I withdrew in my fourth year and came to find something I have a true passion for!</p>
			
			<br>
			
			<p class="lhOneEM">I currently work for an independent jewelry appraisal firm - Just Appraisers - as a Developer and Research Analyst. I also freelance as a Developer. I wasn't hired by Just Appraisers to develop their website(s) or applications. I just had an unstoppable urge to digitize their business! So, I took on the challenge! I hit the ground running... the more I progressed the more questions I had. This led to: more research, more answers, more questions, more research, more answers, etc. I learned whatever I could in order to recreate Just Appraiser's web presence. I've spent the past three years studying, rebuilding and implementing a digital brand for Just Appraisers.</p>
			
			<br>
			
			<p class="lhOneEM">I can do some of both: front-end and back-end development. I'm well versed in html5 and css3, have experience in PHP and JS but I am by no means competent, have done a lot of work under the Wordpress roof, and am teaching myself how to develop using the famous-for-scalability: .Net framework.</p>
			
			<br>
			
			<p class="lhOneEM">On January 10, 2017 I started Rutgers Coding Bootcamp to help me work towards becoming a "real" Full-Stack Developer. When I go to work everyday, I run into issues and problems I don't know how to solve. This serves as a constant reminder of how much I don't know. I look forward to learning as much as I can in the Bootcamp and other experiences that lie ahead of me!</p>
